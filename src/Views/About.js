							<h2>Philosophy: Good Food Matters!</h2>
							<p>
								Hey there, mon chere'! We live for and love to eat Good Food! It
								makes <b>ZERO</b> sense to us to plate <i>something</i> that
								tastes anything short of absolutely delicious and looks like
								meh...What a wasted dish! üôäüôâüôà We don't do that 'round these
								parts!

							<h2>Who We Are</h2>
							<p>
								We are a multi-award winning restaurant where folks are greeted
								with the heart of the South...it's simply Good Food. Food so
								good, you wanna tell the world how darn good it is! Food so
								good, you'll want a second helping, or a third, or a fourth! No
								worries, we got you covered there!
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								As you can see, we are proud to have been supported as a local
								fan favorite for over 20 years. Thank you so much to all the
								people from around the world that have swung by to see us and
								share in our Good Food Philosophy.

								Site Inspiration:Love of GOOD FOOD! üòç I believe that potential
								employers will wish to hire me based on this website because it
								pretty much is a functional, informational website. Most people
								who have no idea about software development may even think that
								this site represents a real business, even though this is my
								imagination at work. It shows that I can manage projects until
								completion, adhering to detailed instruction from leadership,
								but allows my personality, style, and flair to also be showcased
								in the work.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Site Features: This website was created using HTML, CSS,
								Bootstrap, and Javascript. In Level 1, we learned to create and
								style basic websites, run functions, attach images/videos,
								create grids and cards. In Level 2 of the course, we have
								expanded our knowledgebase; we can attach and create image maps,
								process forms, simulate server responses, extract data from REST
								APIs, and use SASS styling upgrades, including mixins,
								transitions and animations --all of which has been integrated
								into this website.
