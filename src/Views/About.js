				<h2>Philosophy: Good Food Matters!</h2>
				<p>
					Hey there, mon chere'! We live for and love to eat Good Food! It makes{" "}
					<b>ZERO</b> sense to us to plate <i>something</i> that tastes anything
					short of absolutely delicious and looks like meh...What a wasted dish!
					üôäüôâüôà We don't do that 'round these parts!

				<h2>Who We Are</h2>
				<p>
					We are a multi-award winning restaurant where folks are greeted with
					the heart of the South...it's simply Good Food. Food so good, you
					wanna tell the world how darn good it is! Food so good, you'll want a
					second helping, or a third, or a fourth! No worries, we got you
					covered there!
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					As you can see, we are proud to have been supported as a local fan
					favorite for over 20 years. Thank you so much to all the people from
					around the world that have swung by to see us and share in our Good
					Food Philosophy.

					Site Inspiration:Love of GOOD FOOD! üòç I believe that potential
					employers will wish to hire me based on this website because it pretty
					much is a functional, informational website. Most people who have no
					idea about software development may even think that this site
					represents a real business, even though this is my imagination at
					work. It shows that I can manage projects until completion, adhering
					to detailed instruction from leadership, but allows my personality,
					style, and flair to also be showcased in the work.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Site Features: This website was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
					and Javascript. In Level 1, we learned to create and style basic
					websites, run functions, attach images/videos, create grids and cards.
					In Level 2 of the course, we have expanded our knowledgebase; we can
					attach and create image maps, process forms, simulate server
					responses, extract data from REST APIs, and use SASS styling upgrades,
					including mixins, transitions and animations --all of which has been
					integrated into this website.
